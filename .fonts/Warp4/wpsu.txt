WORKPLACE SANS FONT
  Version 0.91 (2012-10-17)

INTRODUCTION

  Workplace Sans is a semi-condensed sans-serif TrueType font with Unicode
  encoding.  It has been designed for use as a dialog/user interface font, and
  is inspired by the OS/2 bitmap font "WarpSans".

  Workplace Sans is not well hinted, and therefore displays best under
  environments where it can be anti-aliased.  Alternatively, I provide
  builds which include embedded bitmaps for certain point sizes, which I
  recommend using if anti-aliasing is not available.


INSTALLATION

  To install this font under OS/2, use the Font Palette (choose 'Edit', then
  'Add', and type in the name of the temporary directory where the font files
  are located).

  To install under Windows, use the menu options of the Font applet under the
  Control Panel to install the font.

  To upgrade from a previous release under either Windows or OS/2, close all
  applications, then copy the TTF files over the existing copies (usually
  located in \PSFONTS under OS/2, or \WINNT\FONTS under Win2K/XP).  If you get
  an error that the file cannot be written, you may have to reboot first.  In
  either case, you will have to reboot after updating the file.

  Users of other operating systems should undertake whatever steps are
  appropriate for their platform.

DESIGN NOTES

  The general design objectives of Workplace Sans have shifted several times
  over its history.  The earliest versions (up to V0.4) focused on trying to
  rasterize as closely as possible to the WarpSans bitmap font at one or two
  specific point sizes.  However, after Workplace Sans was adopted as the
  standard  interface font for various projects which use FreeType for anti-
  aliasing text, I decided to relax that principle somewhat in favour of
  making the font look more consistent and attractive when antialiased at all
  sizes.

  Starting with V0.8, I've decided to move much more sharply away from the
  goal of having the rasterized outlines resemble WarpSans.  There seems to
  be little point in compromising design consistency to this end, since I am
  now providing (optional) embedded bitmaps which closely mimic the appearance
  of WarpSans at the applicable point sizes.

  Those who want the WarpSans style in their menus and dialogs can use the
  bitmapped versions, leaving me free to provide a font which is readable and
  consistent-looking at a variety of sizes.

  Workplace Sans corresponds (so far as is possible) to WarpSans at the
  following point sizes:

                     96dpi                     120dpi
    WarpSans 04x14:  9.Workplace Sans          7.Workplace Sans
    WarpSans 06x16:  11.Workplace Sans         9.Workplace Sans

  The resemblance to WarpSans is only approximate, unless the bitmapped
  versions are used.


NOTICES

  This typeface was inspired by the OS/2 bitmap font "WarpSans", which is
  presumed to be copyright (C) IBM Corporation.  However, as an outline
  font, Workplace Sans is in all legal and practical senses an independent
  creative work, and cannot be considered a derivative of the former.

  The 15-pixel embedded bitmaps (corresponding to 9pt at 120 dpi) are
  visually very similar to those of WarpSans.  However, they were derived
  independently by rasterizing the outlines and then cleaning up the images
  manually.  It is the author's belief that this process is sufficiently
  independent to avoid any infringments.  (According to U.S. law, font
  bitmap designs are not copyrightable; only the actual implementation is
  protected.)
